## If proper planning prevents poor performance, then I'm an Olympic athlete. 

Sometimes programming doesn't really translate well into common language so let me just try to explain by example.  

Imagine you are trying to paint your house, and you end up going into the paint business with competitors like Sherwin-Williams. You never got around to painting your house.

I've never had so many mixed emotions in my life. Call me crazy. At one point, I felt bad for myself because I didn't know how to help myself. On the other hand, I wanted to tell everyone how I felt. I don't think that anyone ever takes me seriously. Maybe that's a good thing? I don't know.  

Good conversation.
